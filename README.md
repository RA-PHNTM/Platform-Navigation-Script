# Platform-Navigation-Script
Python tool with GUI interface I used to navigate to different Web-based platforms or URLs. Useful for working with multiple SIEM/EDR platform proxy servers like Security Onion, Stealthwatch or Carboon black. Can also be used as a simple navigation tool for frequented websites/domains. Requires additional edit/tuning to list entities and navigate to intended location obviously.

Features:

*Dropdown menu that lists all entities based on letters entered (autocomplete)

*Double-clickable options

*GUI Window with color

*Web-browsing capability
